THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED BY GE HEALTHCARE THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THIS CASE. MULTIPLE CLINICAL SIGNS PRESENTED THAT INDICATED FETAL DISTRESS DURING THE MONITORING SESSION TO WHICH THE OB TEAM DID NOT TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS: LOW FETAL HEART RATE VARIABILITY- A HEALTHY FETUS HAS HIGH HEART RATE VARIABILITY. MATERNAL HEART RATE WAS VERY CLOSE TO FETAL HEART RATE; THE STRIP CHART INDICATED THE MATERNAL HEART RATE AND FETAL HEART RATE ACTUALLY OVERLAPPED 5 TIMES DURING THE MONITORING SESSION, AS SHOWN BY THE HBC INDICATION- A HEALTHY FETAL HEART RATE IS TYPICALLY HIGHER THAN THE MATERNAL HEART RATE. FETAL HEART RATE ACCELERATED DURING CONTRACTIONS- A HEALTHY FETUS WOULD HAVE HEART RATE DECELERATIONS DURING MATERNAL CONTRACTIONS. MULTIPLE MATERNAL PARAMETERS TO INDICATE THE MOTHER WAS AT HIGH RISK FOR A COMPLICATED BIRTHING PROCESS, I.E. SHE WAS OVERWEIGHT, TACHYCARDIC, AND FEVERISH. THE OB TEAM ATTEMPTED TO USE A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE (FSE) TO OBTAIN A FETAL HEART RATE DIRECTLY ON FOUR OCCASIONS WITH TWO DIFFERENT ELECTRODES. THEY OBSERVED NO GOOD SIGNAL FROM THE FSE ATTEMPTS AND CONCLUDED THE ELECTRODES WERE DEFECTIVE, INSTEAD OF CONCLUDING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FETUS. ONE OF THE OBSTETRICIANS COMMUNICATED THEY DO NOT LOOK AT THE MONITOR STRIP CHART AT ALL. ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE OB TEAM COMMUNICATED THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT OVERLAPPING HEARTRATES AND, THEREFORE, DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE INDICATIONS. THE OBSTETRICIANS COMMUNICATED THEY DID NOT READ THE MONITOR USER'S MANUAL AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND HEARTBEAT COINCIDENCE. THE OBSTETRICIANS APPLIED, REMOVED, AND THEN APPLIED SPO2 AGAIN. WHEN SPO2 WAS APPLIED AND INDICATED A MATERNAL HEART RATE THAT WAS OVERLAPPING WITH THE FETAL HEART RATE, APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WERE NOT TAKEN. THE OBSTETRICIANS DID NOT CONSIDER THE TWO HEART BEATS WERE BOTH FROM THE MOTHER AND THAT THE FETAL HEART BEAT WAS NOT BEING DETECTED. GE HEALTHCARE PROVIDED TRAINING ON THE DEVICE WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY HOSPITAL STAFF SEVERAL MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. THE HOSPITAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THEIR CLINICIANS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED ON THE DEVICE THROUGH PERSONNEL TURNOVER CYCLES, ETC. THE GE TRAINING WAS PROVIDED ONE TIME ONLY AND WAS NOT PURCHASED AGAIN FOR NEW CLINICIANS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE THE ORIGINAL TRAINING. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE WAS USER ERROR INTERPRETING THE CLINICAL SITUATION OF THE MOTHER AND THE FETUS.><THE LEGAL COMPLAINT THAT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY RECEIVED ALLEGES THE FOLLOWING: \"\"THE COROMETRICS MONITOR MADE IT APPEAR TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT THE FETAL HEART RATE WAS BEING MONITORED THROUGHOUT LABOR AND WAS NORMAL.\"\" \"\"HOWEVER, AT SOME POINT HOURS BEFORE DELIVERY, HIS FETAL HEART RATE BECAME DISTRESSED.

BIOMED CHANGED AA BATTERIES AND GOT THE SAME ISSUE OF 'LOW BATTERY' WITHIN 1-2 MINUTES.  TECH OPENED BATTERY CASE AND ON REMOVING ONE OF THE TWO BATTERIES FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY HOT TO TOUCH.  ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE NEGATIVE POLE SPRING (THE BATTERY TOWARDS THE OUT SIDE OF THE CASE) HAD SLIPPED OVER THE TOP OF RETAINING CLIP AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH WIRE FROM THE BATTERY CLOSER TO THE TOUCH PAD.  THE LOAD ON OUTSIDE BATTERY WAS GREATLY INCREASED AND OVERHEATED.  THE BATTERY INDICATOR WAS DISPLAYING 'LOW BATTERY' ON THE UNIT'S SCREEN.  IN A SIMULATED SITUATION IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE OUTSIDE BATTERY WAS HEATING UP TO ~ 196.5 F DEGREES.  THE PLASTIC RETAINING CLIP 'GRINDS DOWN' OVER TIME.  THERE IS NO APPARENT WAY TO REPLACE THE CLIP. PATIENTS HAVE COMPLAINED THE PACK GETS HOT BUT WE HAD NEVER DISCOVERED THE CAUSE UNTIL NOW.HEALTH PROFESSIONAL'S IMPRESSION: WEAR AND TEAR ON A PLASTIC RETAINING CLIP THAT ALLOWS A NEGATIVE POLE BATTERY SPRING TO SLIP UP OVER TOP OF CLIP AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH SECOND AA BATTERY.

(B)(6) THE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCED A NUMBER OF ISSUES. MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF DATABASE SERVER (DBS) REBOOTING CAUSING THE PATIENT INFORMATION CENTER (PICS) TO GO INTO LOCAL MODE AND FOR THE CLIENTS TO GO OFF LINE. MOUSE FAILURES WITH THE REMOTE CPU SOLUTION AND KEY BOARD, MONITOR, VIDEO (KVM) SWITCHES. THE PIC REBOOTS OR GOES BLANK RANDOMLY; PIC RECOVERS, HOWEVER DATA IS LOST DURING THE TIME OF THE 'BLANKING' OR REBOOTING. PRINTERS ARE GOING OFF LINE AND UNABLE TO PRINT. SYSTEM TESTED FOR HARDWARE FAILURES AND OR OBVIOUS CONFIGURATION ISSUES. SOME HARDWARE DEVICES KVM SWITCH AND MOUSE WERE REPLACED. THE RESULT OF THE PROCESS WAS THE PHILIPS LOCAL SERVICE ENGINEER WAS UNABLE TO ISOLATE ANY OBVIOUS SOURCE OF FAILURE. THERE WAS A FORMAL ESCALATION IN (B)(4) TO THE PHILIPS REGION SUPPORT MANAGER. ALL LOGS FROM SERVERS WERE SENT TO PHILIPS MONITORING HQ FOR ANALYSIS. DBS REBOOTS ERROR LOGS INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM WAS THOUGHT THAT IT HAD RUN OUT OF AVAILABLE MEMORY AND CREATED A REBOOT TO DUMP ITS MEMORY CONTENT. PHILIPS ANALYZED THE SOFTWARE CODE AND DISCOVERED AN ERROR IN THE CODE THAT CREATED AN ERRONEOUS MEMORY CAP. A PATCH WAS CREATED IN (B)(4) WHICH CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. PRINTERS GOING OFF LINE WERE HOSPITAL PROCURED PRINTERS WHICH POSSESS 2 NIC CARDS INSTEAD OF ONE. THIS PROBLEM WAS MOST PREVALENT ON THE LEAST ACTIVE PRINTERS AND PHILIPS PROVIDED 2 DIVISION PRINTERS FOR THESE AREAS WHICH WERE INSTALLED IN (B)(4) WITH NO FURTHER ISSUES. PIC REBOOTS ANALYSIS OF THE ERROR LOGS INDICATED 2 TYPES OF ERROR GENERATED BY THE PICS WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE A DOCUMENTED A REBOOT OCCURRENCE LOSS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE DBS AND NETWORK MESSAGING A 'DR WATSON' ERROR (A SOFTWARE ERROR THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN COPYING OR PASTING FILES USING WINDOWS EXPLORER). IN (B)(4) THE MEMORY LEAK PATCH WAS PERFORMED WHICH ELIMINATED THE REBOOTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DBS REBOOT. REBOOTS GENERATING THE OTHER ERROR CONTINUE. REMOTE SERVER NETWORK (RSN) CONNECTION ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE DOWNLOADS OF ERROR LOGS AND DEPLOYMENT OF REPORTING TOOLS THAT CAPTURE AND DRILL DOWN. MOUSE LOCK UPS IN THE REMOTE SOLUTION LED TO INVESTIGATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THE REMOTE CPU AND KVM SWITCH. THE INITIAL TECHNOLOGY INSTALLED EXTENDED THE PS/2 MOUSE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS BETWEEN THE CPU AND MOUSE. THE LOCKUPS TEND TO OCCUR RANDOMLY AND HAVE HAPPENED IN ALL FOUR WORKSTATIONS, HOWEVER, MOST PREVALENT IN THE STATIONS ALONG THE WINDOW. REMEDY WAS TO CONVERT THE REMOTE SOLUTION FROM A PS/2 TO A USB, REPLACE HARDWARE COMPONENTS WITH ANOTHER STYLE, AND UPGRADE TO 'KAVOOM' KVM SWITCH SOFTWARE.
